The ui-ux repository.

The drupal client should focus on the two types of views.
A primary account holder who can see how he is doing and how everyone else is doing in details
An AU holder who can see how he is doing personally with a gauge for saving and a gauge for current balance and a gauge for available balance. The AU holder only sees how it is doing compared to others through a dynamic ranking system using the three models.

We should actually rank in categories or shouldn't we? Meaning the kids compete together, the parents and the tenagers. This is a bit silly but we should make it possible. Ranking is based on groups. At the begining everyone is in a family group that can be refined into parents, kids, tenagers and grownups.
